## Description

Tip.ly is a simple tip calculator application developed in Swift for the iOS platform. 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Implemented a slider to set a custom tip percentage.
- [x] Implemented additional Settings toggle for remembering and setting a custom tip percentage value.

## Notes

Many of the challenges that I encountered while building this project were mostly related to getting familiarized with Xcode dev environment and Swift language syntax.
